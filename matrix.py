def determinant(matrix):
    '''
    Calculate the determinant of a given matrix

    matrix (list of lists): a matrix in the form of a list of lists. the element in the i'th row and j'th column is accesible by matrix[i][j] (indexing is 0 based)  

    You MUST use recursion for this part. Non-recursive solutions will not be
    accepted.

    Returns: determinant of the matrix

    Example:
    >>> determinant([[2,3,1],[-4,5,2], [2,1,-4]])
    -94
