def print_paths(grid):
    '''
    Print all of the paths starting from the top-left cell and ending in the bottom-right cell such that the path is strictly increasing.

    grid (list of lists): The grid that we are moving on. It is a matrix in the form of list of lists. the element in the i'th row and j'th column is accesible by grid[i][j] (indexing is 0 based)

    You MUST use recursion for this part. Non-recursive solutions will not be
    accepted.

    Example:
    >>> print_paths([[1,4,3],[5,6,7]])
    [1, 4, 6, 7]
    [1, 5, 6, 7]

    Note: depending on your implementation, you may print the permutations in
    a different order than what is listed here.
