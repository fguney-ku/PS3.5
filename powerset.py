def generate_powerset(input_set):
    '''
    Enumerate all subsets of a given string

    input_set (list): an arbitrary list. Assume that it does not contain any duplicate elements.  

    You MUST use recursion for this part. Non-recursive solutions will not be
    accepted.

    Returns: a list of lists containing all the subsets of input_set

    Example:
    >>> generate_powerset([1, 2, 3])
    [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]

    Note: depending on your implementation, you may return the susbsets in
    a different order than what is listed here.
